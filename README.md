# Hackthon-Project- Honda indoor navigation

**Background**: <br>
Navigating large indoor complex spaces is often challenging due to complex layouts and the limitations of traditional aids
like static maps, signs, and phone-based GPS.
<br>

**Challenge**: <br>
Make indoor navigation in complex spaces more intuitive, personalized, and accessible. 
<br>

**Context**: <br>
By "interior navigation," we mean the art of finding your way in large, complex indoor spaces like shopping malls, airports, hospitals,or college campuses. Reflect on your last experience navigating such a space. Could it have been improved? "Better" in this context can mean more efficient, less confusing, or simply more accessible.
Traditional tools like static maps and signs often need to catch up. They need to be more user-friendly, they can adapt to individual needs, and they don't offer real-time updates. So here's your challenge: First, brainstorm scenarios where indoor navigation proves to be challenging.Consider a visitor struggling to locate a department on a labyrinthine college campus, someone frantically searching for a specific store in a vast shopping mall, or a traveler hustling through an airport to make a connecting flight.
Once you've identified the problem, it's time to get creative. By "innovative solutions," we mean a wide array of options, from web or mobile apps to AI integration or hardware implementations. You can also employ "design thinking," a problem-solving approach that involves deeply understanding the user's needs and creatively finding solutions that meet those needs. The goal is to make the indoor navigation experience more intuitive, personalized, and accessible for many users. There are no constraints on the technology or method you choose; the aim is to elevate the indoor navigation experience significantly.

**Deliverables**: <br>
We expect deliverables to include a video pitch that articulates your team's understanding of the indoor navigation problem,  presents your proposed innovative solution, and shares key learnings acquired during the project. 
<br>



**Judging**: <br>
Solutions will be judged on: 
• Problem Solving: Evaluation of how effectively your solution addresses the identified indoor navigation challenge.
• Creativity: Assessment of the originality and innovation in your approach to solving the problem. 
• Clarity: Measurement of how clearly your team articulates the problem and proposed solution in the video pitch. 
• Completeness: Review of the thoroughness and detail in your proposed solution, including all necessary components. 
• Impact: Judgment on the potential real-world effectiveness and reach of your solution
